Objective

The goal of this project is to build a simple rock paper scissors game using javascript.

Reflections 

The current state of the game seems to be functional. I spent alot of time trying to figure out how to end a round after 5 or 10 wins, though unsuccessful, hopefully I am able to implement this feature in the future.
